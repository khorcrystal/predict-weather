# predict-weather

The purpose of this project is to analyze weather data from a station at Oakland International Airport. I performed time series analysis on weather data, where the goal is to build a prediction function for the maximum temperature in a given month based on various weather parameters. This project involves using regression analysis and rolling means to create various predictors and then adding monthly and daily averages to the data to refine the predictions.
